      Ritchey Saddles:

    <p>
      I really enjoy Ritchey Saddles, they are some of the most comfortable saddles I have used, and I've used quite a few. They come in multiple styles to fit your style, 
          with open centers or closed centers, whichever you prefer. I have used both types and they are both super comfortable. They are also super light while still being 
          structally sound! Some lighter seats are not very strong and break easily but not Ritchey Saddles, they have the best of both worlds, lightness and strong structure
          plus they are super comfortable!

                I have a few different sets of Rudy Sunglasses that I use and greatly enjoy! There are some sets that had lenses that are super easy to change, I will change 
                the shade of lenses in that pair depending on the weather becasue they are so easy. Plus the nose piece and the rear half of the frames are adjustable to fit 
                your head. They are super comfortable and if I can I hope to use only Rudy Sunglasses for the rest of my life!
