        <p>Race Report</p>
        <p>Sequim Road Race 3/12:</p>
        <p>Sequim was my first real road race, and I think it went well. I ended up 7th out of almost 30 in the Cat 4/5 women which was pretty good for my first one. 
            I tried to attack a few times and failed, nobody was able to get away from the group and it ended in a group sprint. We were also nuetralized about 10k from the 
            finish which made things interesting. There were a lot of things I'm looking to do better at for this next weekend at Mason Lake but overall I think I did good.</p>
