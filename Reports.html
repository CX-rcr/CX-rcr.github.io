      <p><strong>Race Report</strong></p>
      <p>Sequim Road Race 3/12/22:</p>
      <p>Sequim was my first real road race, and I think it went well. I ended up 7th out of almost 30 in the Cat 4/5 women which was pretty good for my first one. 
          I tried to attack a few times and failed, nobody was able to get away from the group and it ended in a group sprint. We were also nuetralized about 10k from the 
          finish which made things interesting. There were a lot of things I'm looking to do better at for this next weekend at Mason Lake but overall I think I did good.</p>
      <p>Mason Lake Road Race #1 3/19/22:</p>
      <p>Mason Lake went even better than Sequim did. I ended up 3rd out of 16 in the Cat 4/5 women in a sprint finish. There was a lot of wind which made for an 
          exciting race, and everyone was attacking all the time which made it excitng too. Just like Sequim, nobdoy was able to get away fromt the group and it 
          ended with a sprint finish. The sprnt started really early, just after 1k to go and when the first attackers started to fade at about 700 meters to go I
          attacked and had a small gap that I held till just before 200 meters to go where first passed me and second passed me with about 100 meters to go. I was
          able to hold off fourth but it was close. It was a fun day and I improved from the week before, and now I can't wait to make adjustments and do it again 
          at the next race!</p>
      <p>Mason Lake Road Race #2 3/26/22:</p>
      <p>My second Mason Lake went better than Sequim but not as good as my first Mason Lake. I ended up 5th out 16 in the Cat 4/5 women in a sprint finish. There was
          little to no wind this time which changed how the course raced, the section that was a headwind was harder and the section that was a tailwind was easier. 
          A one-person break was able to form and stay away for about a lap, and then they came back and everyone started attacking and counterattacking, including me
