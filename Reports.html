        Sequim Road Race 3/12/22:
        <span class="icon">^</span>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Sequim was my first real road race, and I think it went well. I ended up 7th out of almost 30 in the Cat 4/5 women which was pretty good for my first one. 
          I tried to attack a few times and failed, nobody was able to get away from the group and it ended in a group sprint. We were also nuetralized about 10k from the 
          finish which made things interesting. There were a lot of things I'm looking to do better at for this next weekend at Mason Lake but overall I think I did good.

        Mason Lake Road Race #1 3/19/22:
        <span class="icon">^</span>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Mason Lake went even better than Sequim did. I ended up 3rd out of 16 in the Cat 4/5 women in a sprint finish. There was a lot of wind which made for an 
          exciting race, and everyone was attacking all the time which made it excitng too. Just like Sequim, nobdoy was able to get away fromt the group and it 
          ended with a sprint finish. The sprnt started really early, just after 1k to go and when the first attackers started to fade at about 700 meters to go I
          attacked and had a small gap that I held till just before 200 meters to go where first passed me and second passed me with about 100 meters to go. I was
          able to hold off fourth but it was close. It was a fun day and I improved from the week before, and now I can't wait to make adjustments and do it again 
          at the next race!

        Mason Lake Road Race #2 3/26/22:
        <span class="icon">^</span>
      </summary>
      <p>
        My second Mason Lake went better than Sequim but not as good as my first Mason Lake. I ended up 5th out 16 in the Cat 4/5 women in a sprint finish. There was
          little to no wind this time which changed how the course raced, the section that was a headwind was harder and the section that was a tailwind was easier. 
          A one-person break was able to form and stay away for about a lap, and then they came back and everyone started attacking and counterattacking, including me
          although nobody was able to form another break. It ended up in a sprint again and I was trying to be second or third wheel coming into about 200-300 meters to
          go to change from what I did the week before but in the process I ended up bixing myself in and then when I actually sprinted I could only pass so many people
          and ended up 5th. It was dissapointing becasue I wanted to improve on last week but I am doing what I can to learn from this race and improve next time.

        Seward Park 4/5 Women 4/14/22:
        <span class="icon">^</span>
      </summary>
      <p>
        I did pretty good in my first Seward of the year. I ended up 2nd out of about 10 in the Cat 4/5 women, which is good but I was wanting to win and had a decent 
          chance before I messed things up. I tried to let soembody else chase when a Fount rider attacked on the climb but nobody else did and she got away and I couldn't
          chase her down. I tried to race 'smart' and not work a lot and in the end I messed things up for myself in the process. I can't wait for next week though because
          it was a shockingly large feild and I can't wait to improve and hopefully win!

        Seward Park B group 4/14/22:
        <span class="icon">^</span>
      </summary>
      <p>
        After I finished the 4/5 Women race I went back out and raced in the B group, I managed to stay with the group for 10 minutes before I got dropped the first time. 
          I then tried to get back in the group twice but wasn't able to stay in the group for longer than a lap or two. I think that I was strong enough to stay in the
          group I just wasn't racing smart. I was at the back where the yo-yo is the worst and had a mental attitude that set me up for failure so next week I am going to 
          start the race with a better attitude and race a little bit smarter and see where that gets me.
